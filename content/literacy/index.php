  <p>
    Most users of Cricket are responsible, to one extent or another, for
    furthering this thing people are calling the "information age" or the
    "new economy". Whatever you call it, it's clear that basic literacy
    is a fundamental requirement to take part in the emerging world of
    information. And for a number of reasons, not everyone who needs to
    be able to read and write can do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where literacy programs come in. By reaching out to people who
    want to learn to read, they give people the tools they need to survive
    and thrive in our increasingly complex world. I believe that people can
    and should work to support themselves. But I also believe that those of
    us who already have the tools to succeed have a responsibility to get
    those tools into the hands of others, so that they may succeed too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some Cricket users have in the past offered me gifts as a reward for my
    work on Cricket. Instead, I would be honored if you'd donate to a
    literacy program in the name of Cricket users everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="pr.html">East Palo Alto Project Read</a> is a adult literacy
    program in my area. I encourage you to give donations and your own time
    to support this program, or one in your area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, we can make a difference in the lives of people who need to read.
  </p>
  <p>Sincerely, Jeff R. Allen</p>
