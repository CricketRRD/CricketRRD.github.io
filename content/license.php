      Cricket is licensed under the GNU General Public License. This means
      that it is a copyrighted piece of software with specific rules governing
      its distribution. In particular, these rules guarantee any user of Cricket
      the right to see and modify the source code. There is a lot more
      information about <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a>
      available from the folks at the <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org"><abbr title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</abbr></a>.
    </p>
    <p>Briefly, here's my understanding of the implications of copyleft:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want to fetch Cricket off the net and use it, you are free
        to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to make changes to it and use it, you are free to do so,
        because you have an absolute right to be able to see the source code
        of Cricket.
       </li>
      <li>
        If you want to make money by offering your services as a person who
        is good at installing Cricket, you are free to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to make money by selling a proprietary product that
        consists of Cricket and possibly changes to Cricket, you may only
        do so if your customers have complete access to the Cricket source
        code and to the source code for your changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to install Cricket and make money off of the information
        that Cricket displays, you may do so.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That last one is important, and bears more discussion. Many commercial
      organizations are using Cricket or systems derived from it and RRD Tool
      to provide valuable quality of service data to their customers. This is
      <strong>great</strong>! I'm proud to have helped make it possible for
      people to share this kind of data. However, I ask that people who are
      making money using Cricket consider returning some of the value that you
      get from Cricket to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can give back by being an active member of the Cricket community
      (submitting code, helping with documentation, or answering questions
      on the mailing lists). Or, you could make <a href="literacy/">donations
      to a charity</a> on behalf of Cricket users everywhere.

    <p>
      I reserve the right to publically expose you if you are in violation of
      the <abbr title="General Public License">GPL</abbr>. Since he's more
      eloquent, I'll let <a
        href="http://photo.net/philg/litigation/philosophy.html">Philip
      Greenspun explain</a> my philosophy regarding this type of situation.
