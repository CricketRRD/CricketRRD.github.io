<p>
When you report a bug in Cricket, post a patch to Cricket to the
Patch Manager, or file a Feature Request, please follow these guidelines
to streamline the process.

<h2>Be reachable</h2>

<p>
Often, when a change is made in Cricket, we need feedback from the
person who requested that change. If that person didn't leave an address,
we lose. So, in order of preference, please

<ul>
<li>Log on to Sourceforge prior to filing your report (the top of the
Sourceforge sidebar will show "Logged in: <i>your username</i>"). That
way, when someone updates the report, you will be notified immediately.
<li>If that is not possible (you're in a hurry, your browser is acting
up, or the dog ate your homework), than by all means use the "anonymous"
posting facility (where the sidebar says "NOT LOGGED IN"). If you do
that, please leave your name and e-mail address as the <i>first</i> line
of your report. It's not as easy to reply, but at least we can if we need
to.
</ul>

<p>
Anonymous reports that do not start with a valid e-mail address will
get closed without further comment. Otherwise, we just spend too much time
tracking down people.
<p>

<h2>Check the mailing lists first</h2>

<p>
Before you file your report on Sourceforge, please ascertain that your
issue is new. Even if the Google can't find the answer and searching
the mailing list archives draws a blank, it's quick and easy to ask in
the cricket-users mailing list. The Sourceforge bug, patch and feature
request reports are used by the developers mostly to track progress and
to make sure good ideas don't fall by the wayside.

<h2>When in doubt, ask on cricket-users</h2>

<p>
When you are not sure if you should ask on cricket-users or file a report
here, just post to cricket-users. We'll be quick to tell you if we need
a report on Sourceforge. Most developers check their e-mail frequently,
so at least one is likely to answer.
