Greetings all,
<BR>
<P>So today the router guys brought down several routers that I am monitoring (at
<BR>
their request). About the same time, the load on my monitoring server
<BR>
sky-rocketed. By the time I got the page from Netsaint, whatever process it was
<BR>
had finished, but I think it is/was Cricket.
<BR>
<P>I was lucky enough to attend LISA in Seatle this past fall and see our own JRA
<BR>
speak about the joy that is Cricket. In that speach he mentioned that they
<BR>
(WebTV) where monitoring how long Cricket took to run. Anyone else have
<BR>
something setup to do this? I know that when those routers went down, it was
<BR>
taking just 15 seconds shy of 5 minutes to finish collecting everything
<BR>
(Yikes!). This could very easily turn into the old MRTG circle of death if just
<BR>
another router or 2 changed/went down without being removed from Cricket...
<BR>
<P>I chuckle to myself thinking about looking at a Cricket graph showing how long
<BR>
Cricket was taking to finish its collections...
<BR>
<P>Thanks all,
<BR>
<P>P.S. if anyone is bothered by my posting info about my Netsaint/Cricket coding
<BR>
please yell at me off list :-) I am having lots of fun right now writing
<BR>
scripts that gather all kinds of fun info from my Servers that gets
<BR>
collected/graphed by Netsaint/Cricket (yesterday I started graphing the average
<BR>
number of messages in my Qmail Queue and today I hope to start graphing average
<BR>
number of messages/bytes going in and out, weeee!). Current releases are always
<BR>
available at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cybertrails.com/pub/sysadmin/netsaintcricket/">ftp://ftp.cybertrails.com/pub/sysadmin/netsaintcricket/</A>
