<EM>&gt;      Ping will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate packets

<EM>&gt; should

<EM>&gt;      not always be cause for alarm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, this does not sound good, could this be normal?? cause for alarm?? what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be causing it.

<P>I suspect that pinging a broadcast address is different situation.
<BR>
You send out a single ECHO.  You receive the first ECHO-REPY.  Good.
<BR>
You receive another ECHO-REPLY to the same ECHO.  Huh?  DUPLICATE.
<BR>
That is normal behavior, when pinging a broadcast address.  Every node on
<BR>
that netwok will respond.  If you ping a node that is not a broadcast
<BR>
address and you receive DUP packets, then yes, that _is_ bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  I have read networking books that state when using a classfull routing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocol such as RIP that you should not use masks other than the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; class ones.  They say you could possibly do it but that the mask should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always be larger than what you are using by default on other equipment. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, if you have a class C subnet with a mask of 24, then it states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you should only use masks &gt; 24. e.g. DONT use a 23 bit net mask.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question is: why is this bad?? It doesn't seem to cause problems.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, on network using RIP, we want subnet with 512 hosts(23 bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; netmask), since all hosts don't have netmask set properly, two routes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used. For example, 192.168.1.0/23 would be the proper way, however, you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also use 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 since RIP doesn't know about 24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit netmask and this will also work. Of course, you lose 192.168.2.0 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 192.168.1.255 as valid addresses, but it seems to work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why is this bad??
</EM><BR>
<P>Possible has to do with route aggregation/summarization which RIP doesn't
<BR>
do. The smaller the netmask you use to announce routes with RIP, the more
<BR>
routes you have to announce, the larger your RIP table is. Using a routing
<BR>
protocol like OSPF that can aggregate your samller routes, this becomes
<BR>
less of an issue.
<BR>
<P>We actually use rip to announce individual ip addresses (/32) that are
<BR>
dialed into our network, then have the routers perform RIP-&gt;OSPF
<BR>
translation and summarize the routes outbound.
<BR>
<P>Just a guess.
