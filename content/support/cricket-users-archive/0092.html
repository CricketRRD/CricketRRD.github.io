<EM>&gt; scripts, and add ins, and tips and tricks and war stories and unique

<P>See my comments at the end about this.

<EM>&gt; Tim, I'm particularly interested in your &quot;homogeneous Cisco&quot; builder (could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you send me a copy please?).  I'm also interested in what kind of details
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone may be capturing from a Catalyst 5505 or if anyone is tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DE/Drop/FECN/BECN on frame relay interfaces (particularly to see if you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting what you paid for from the frame carrier).
</EM><BR>
<P>I am in the middle of making this work on my set-up.  Currently I am using
<BR>
cricket-0.60.  :)  (Jeff was kind enough to point ou that he hasn't
<BR>
released version 6.0 yet, so I had to give it back)
<BR>
<P>When I am done with the frame-relay stuff, I will post the changes I have
<BR>
made to the Defaults and listInterfaces files.  This is all part of my
<BR>
&quot;homogenous-cisco-environment&quot; plan.  
<BR>
<P>Next working version will be ready by tomorrow night.  Currently I have
<BR>
run into a snag mapping the frame-relay interface back to teh proper
<BR>
ifIndex to make everything work right.  D'oh.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But first I should ask the question:  is this forum appropriate for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of discussion or should a new one be created?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if any of you have been on the mrtg list, that's pretty much what it
<BR>
was used for.  A sort of all-around list.  Scripts, contrib apps,
<BR>
problems, questions not in a FAQ, and anything else people could think of
<BR>
to talk about the software.
<BR>
<P>I personnaly have enough lists I am subscribed to, and would appreciate
<BR>
being able to use this one like that one.
<BR>
