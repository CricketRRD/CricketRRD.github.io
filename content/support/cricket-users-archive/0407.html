<BR>
<P>This is not quite appopriate for this list since these are general
<BR>
networking questions however I cannot seem to find an answer anywhere else
<BR>
on the net.
<BR>
<P>Since most of you are networking professionals I thought I would give it a
<BR>
try.
<BR>
<P>1.  Sending a ping to the broadcast address of several subnets results in
<BR>
DUP packets from almost every responding hosts. The router of these subnets
<BR>
has directed broadcasts turned on. Other routers have directed broadcasts
<BR>
turned off and thus I can not reach them from where I am at.  The man page
<BR>
for ping states this:
<BR>
DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ping will report duplicate and damaged packets.  Duplicate packets
<BR>
should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never occur, and seem to be caused by inappropriate link-level retrans-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missions.  Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if
<BR>
ev-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;er) a good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not always be cause for alarm.
<BR>
<P>Now, this does not sound good, could this be normal?? cause for alarm?? what
<BR>
could be causing it.
<BR>
<P>2.  I have read networking books that state when using a classfull routing
<BR>
protocol such as RIP that you should not use masks other than the standard
<BR>
class ones.  They say you could possibly do it but that the mask should
<BR>
always be larger than what you are using by default on other equipment. For
<BR>
instance, if you have a class C subnet with a mask of 24, then it states
<BR>
that you should only use masks &gt; 24. e.g. DONT use a 23 bit net mask.  My
<BR>
question is: why is this bad?? It doesn't seem to cause problems.  For
<BR>
instance, on network using RIP, we want subnet with 512 hosts(23 bit
<BR>
netmask), since all hosts don't have netmask set properly, two routes are
<BR>
used. For example, 192.168.1.0/23 would be the proper way, however, you can
<BR>
also use 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 since RIP doesn't know about 24
<BR>
bit netmask and this will also work. Of course, you lose 192.168.2.0 and
<BR>
192.168.1.255 as valid addresses, but it seems to work.
<BR>
<P>Why is this bad??
