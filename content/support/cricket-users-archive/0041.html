<BR>
<P>Has anyone tried to make cricket generate some graphs from cron and
<BR>
some graphs on the fly?  I would be happy to modify the code to do this,
<BR>
but I want to make sure I'm not recreating someones work.
<BR>
<P>In our situation, it makes a lot of sense to generate almost all of our
<BR>
graphs dynamically.  However we have a handful which would be better served
<BR>
by periodic creation rather than dynamic creation.
<BR>
<P>I imagine this as a simple:
<BR>
<P>target blah-blah
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graph-generate = dynamic
<BR>
or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graph-generate = static
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graph-lifetime = 5
<BR>
<P><P>The grapher.cgi would know to first look for the static image in a set
<BR>
location (~/cricket-graphs/....), and if it does not find it there it
<BR>
would generate it on the fly.
<BR>
<P>Then a second cron job could be run in addition to the collector which
<BR>
would create the static graphs as they are needed.
<BR>
<P>Since this is my first time posting, I would like to say how much I like
<BR>
cricket.  The code is very well written and easy to customize.
<BR>
<P>- Noam
