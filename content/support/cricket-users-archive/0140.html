<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello.  I'm a newbie.  I'm running Cricket (trying to) version 0.63 and RRDTool version 0.99.28.  I've configured the collector so that it's running without any errors.  There are *.rrd files that have been generated and they are being modified by the collector on regular intervals.  The collector has been running for days now.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT, I cannot get any graphs out of these files.  When I attempt to run grapher.cgi, I get this error on my web server (Apache):
<BR>
<P>Use of uninitialized value at &lt;path deleted&gt;/cricket/grapher.cgi line 1224.
<BR>
[26-May-1999 15:24:05*] No graph to make?
<BR>
[26-May-1999 15:24:05*] Unable to create graph: can't make a graph without contents
<BR>
[26-May-1999 15:24:05*] Could not open /tmp/cricket-cache/cricket-70ea5578.gif: No such file or directory
<BR>
[26-May-1999 15:24:05*] Could not open /tmp/cricket-cache/cricket-fc683733.gif: No such file or directory
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran rrdtool graph &lt;file&gt; and got the error:
<BR>
<P>ERROR: can't make a graph without contents.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then tried cricket/util/rrd-dump and I was suprised to see how little info is in each *.rrd file.  I'm new to this software and I've never seen a running setup, so I can't tell for sure, but there's only about 70 lines of output from the rrd-dump command and much of it is whitespace.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions for me?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank-you,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Maris Abolins
