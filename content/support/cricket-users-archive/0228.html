<BR>
<P>Cricket is a wonderful tool.  We use it to monitor network devices,
<BR>
protocol-level (HTTP, IP) functionality, and internal state of our
<BR>
application servers.  In all we probably monitor around 300-400
<BR>
different values.
<BR>
<P>The biggest functionality area I'd like to see improved upon is the
<BR>
interactiveness of the Grapher.  Here's some scenarios of what I'm
<BR>
thinking about:
<BR>
<P>Scenario 1: interactive scaling
<BR>
-----------
<BR>
Occasionally, we'll have a situation where a value that normally
<BR>
fluctuates around 50% of its median value will shoot up to 1000% of the
<BR>
median because of a counter roll-over problem (RRD still seems to have
<BR>
problems with this), or because of a true transient.  The problem is
<BR>
that now the graphs are 'squashed', making it hard to read the normal
<BR>
variation that occurs.
<BR>
<P>It would be very useful to be able to somehow click on some 'range'
<BR>
setting that would effectively set 'y-max' on a per-request basis.  It's
<BR>
not useful hard-code 'y-max' in the config file, because it disables the
<BR>
nice autoscaling that normally happens.  It might also hide some
<BR>
problems that go above 'y-max'.
<BR>
<P><P>Scenario 2: adding 'event's interactively
<BR>
-----------
<BR>
Let's say we've a graph of ping times to some external service. (Maybe
<BR>
it's an NTP server or a DNS server).  We notice (from both Cricket and
<BR>
'mon') that our connectivity to that service is degraded. At the same
<BR>
time, we get a call from our network provider saying they are upgrading
<BR>
a switch, and that's causing our problem.
<BR>
<P>So, to log this in Cricket, we just click on the ping-time graph at the
<BR>
time the service degradation occured, type in a description (with the
<BR>
ticket number from our provider), and click 'add event'.  From that
<BR>
point on, anyone viewing that graph will see that event in the graphs.
<BR>
<P><P>I'm not sure how either of these would be done, but it would be cool to
<BR>
have both!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my limited knowledge of Cricket, both of these would currently be
</EM><BR>
hard to do, since it seems they both would need to make modifications to
<BR>
the information in 'config.db'.  Even if the grapher _could_ make
<BR>
changes to the config.db, it shouldn't because a) it's a security risk,
<BR>
grapher should be a read-only user of config.db, b) there's no easy way
<BR>
to go from 'config.db' to a config tree, and c) it's just aesthetically
<BR>
displeasing.
<BR>
<P><P>Jeff, have you considered similar things?  To me, having the graphs
<BR>
generated dynamically (unlike MRTG), just begs for them to be made more
<BR>
interactive. :)
