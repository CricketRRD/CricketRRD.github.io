<BR>
<P>Your ideas about static image generation are sound, but let me just be
<BR>
devil's advocate for a second...
<BR>
<P>Noam Freedman wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The grapher.cgi would know to first look for the static image in a set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; location (~/cricket-graphs/....), and if it does not find it there it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would generate it on the fly.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is this different from image caching? With image caching, what we
<BR>
do is turn the parameters into a filename, and serve that image
<BR>
directly if we find it on disk, and it's fresh enough. What you are
<BR>
talking about is making the graph every five minutes whether you are
<BR>
going to look at it or not, and put it on the disk in a certain
<BR>
filename, then serving that file up when asked for it.
<BR>
<P>With the system I use for image caching, we shortcut the entire job of
<BR>
reading the config tree, and instead immediately turn the parameters
<BR>
into a filename. I'm not certain if you'll be able to shortcut the
<BR>
config tree stuff still with your approach -- and that can be a
<BR>
significant cost.
<BR>
<P>Basically, I'm asking you &quot;what is the problem you are trying to
<BR>
solve?&quot;. Is Cricket too slow? If so, CGI overhead (followed closely by
<BR>
Config Tree parsing) is the bottleneck you need to solve, not image
<BR>
drawing time. mod_perl is the right way to solve CGI overhead. As of
<BR>
Cricket 0.64 there will be a new and improved set of routines to talk
<BR>
to the config tree which are much faster.
<BR>
<P>If you feel like you need to make the images statically, and you can
<BR>
do it with simple patches (or preferably, a new companion to collector
<BR>
called &quot;bulk-graph&quot; or something) then I'm ready and willing to
<BR>
integrate your changes. If you need to turn everything on it's head to
<BR>
make static graphs work, I'm not too excited about that, and I will
<BR>
probably exercise my perogative to &quot;lose&quot; your patch... :)
<BR>
<P>Let's talk about this and see if we can make certain we are doing the
<BR>
least work to fix the problem you are having.
<BR>
