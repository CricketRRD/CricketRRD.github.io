<EM>&gt;&gt; I have a situation where some information was gathered via MRTG and

<EM>&gt;&gt; particular, I want to update the &quot;yearly averages&quot; information to fill

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It sounds like you need a tool called &quot;rrd-poke&quot; which would let you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frob arbitrary items in the RRD file, so that oyu could put in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old data into a new file. That tool does not exist, that I know of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I could volunteer to write such a tool, if given some resources.
<BR>
Namely, I would LOVE to know the exact format of the (binary) RRD files. Is
<BR>
there any documentation about it? Tobias?
<BR>
<P>If there's no such documentation, I'd like to know at least what part of
<BR>
RRDTool's source to look into.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Alternatively, you could build a new file by replaying the oldest data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first (from MRTG) then replaying the data from Cricket, then finally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;swapping the current Cricket file for the one you built up by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;replaying the data. It'd be a bit tricky, though.
</EM><BR>
<P>Too tricky. I tried that way, and it did work to some extent. But only for
<BR>
too short amounts of time backward (like a day for fast interfaces, no more
<BR>
than a couple of months for slow ones).
<BR>
<P>First there's the heartbeat and xff problem (the heartbeat and/or the
<BR>
X-files factor in RRDTool must be large enough to accept data averaged over
<BR>
a large amount of time). And RRDTool's tune function won't let me alter the
<BR>
xff parameter later on, when the conversion is done (at least, I see no
<BR>
documentation on doing that).
<BR>
<P>Then, there's the problem that MRTG stores deltas, NOT the original sampled
<BR>
data, forcing you to start from the last point (which is the ONLY point
<BR>
that gets stored literally) backwards.
<BR>
<P>This is the biggest problem. When backtracking, you always get to some time
<BR>
when there's just too much data averaged and things start not to fit in the
<BR>
machine's binary numeric representation (32 bits on the Sparc Ultra?). On
<BR>
fast interfaces, this problem shows up sooner, but if you have more than a
<BR>
couple of months worth of data, even slow interfaces do show this behavior.
<BR>
<P>I then tried to work around this problem by &quot;de-averaging&quot; the data
<BR>
(generating fake data points that amount to the same average) so as to deal
<BR>
with numbers that could actually fit in (my machine's) 32 bits. But even
<BR>
then, if the data was averaged over such a big amount of time as to have
<BR>
more than one numeric overflow between two consecutive averaged points, you
<BR>
start having no way to backtrack without a VERY complex scheme. I then
<BR>
abandoned the idea.
<BR>
<P>That was when I saw your mailing. And that's why I volunteer to write the
<BR>
&quot;rrd-poke&quot; tool. Any help on doing that would be MUCH appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.
