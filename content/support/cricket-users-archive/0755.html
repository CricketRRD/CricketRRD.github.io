<P>Wow, I've never had someone have the same problem as me at the exact same 
<BR>
time, thanks!  :)  After reading the suExec web page I was able to get my 
<BR>
own simple cgi sripts to work, but not the linked scripts.  My solution was 
<BR>
to just forget about running the scripts out of the cricket's home 
<BR>
directory and instead run them (via the standard links) in 
<BR>
/home/httpd/html/cricket instead.  (Personally I've never liked having to 
<BR>
type in that tilde any ways. :) )  I'm pretty new to Linux, but it seems to 
<BR>
me that suExec isn't ran for any scripts that are run of the standard 
<BR>
/home/httpd directory.  Maybe the beginner.txt file should be changed so 
<BR>
that this (http/html/cricket) is the standard install location for the web 
<BR>
files?  It might help RedHat Linux beginners like me any ways.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
JIM
<BR>
<P>PS. I've recently change from digest to plain email for this mailing list, 
<BR>
but now I don't receive any emails from the list, other than my own.  Has 
<BR>
this happened to anyone else?

<P>mmmm, the new machine has RedHat 6.1 and the old has RH 6.0.
<BR>
<P>RH 6.1 comes with a wrapper, and this wrapper doesn't like the idea of having
<BR>
links in public_html pointing to CGIs, I just copied the files and they 
<BR>
worked!!
<BR>
<P><P><P>Here is the file where suexec logs the errors:

/var/log/httpd/suexec_log
<BR>
