<BR>
<P><P><P>Hi.  I have been using mrtg for about 2 years now, to graph interface
<BR>
on the network where I work.
<BR>
I am in the process of migrating to cricket/rrdtool.  I have had
<BR>
cricket/rrdtool running on my network for about 3 months with no apparent
<BR>
problems.  I poll 1099 objects, and it usually takes about 3 minutes and 
<BR>
40 seconds.  Very nice.  Very fast.
<BR>
<P>I am using Cricket-6.0, and will upgrade to 6.4 tomorrw or the next day.
<BR>
<P>Is the a contrib site for scripts or programs that we have written, that
<BR>
we would like to share?
<BR>
<P>I have a Target making script for cisco homogenous environments.  It will
<BR>
define the router types and build the targets file, as one single file,
<BR>
including in that Targets file any routers listed one-per-line in a text
<BR>
file.
<BR>
<P>I have a script that calls listInterfaces, that will put all the routers
<BR>
in their own subdirectories under interfaces, and build the files
<BR>
automatically including making the directories, from the same text file.
<BR>
<P>I also made a very slight change to listInterfaces so that it can
<BR>
differentiate between frame-relay interfaces and other types of
<BR>
sub-interfaces.  We wanted to be able to grab frInOctets, and frOutOctets,
<BR>
and fecns and becns and whatnot.  But we have several CT3's where
<BR>
sub-interface isn't frame-relay, and needed different graphs.
<BR>
You coul dmodify that to recognize ethernet, or ppp, or whatever else if
<BR>
you had somethign specific you wanted to do with that type of interface.
<BR>
<P>Is there anywhere I can put this?   Is there no site, but a need for one?
<BR>
(I'd be happy to host one)
<BR>
<P>Great work, Jeff.  Thanks very much.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>-Tim
