<BR>
<P>Ok I have cricket working now but I am running into an issues that is
<BR>
somewhat annoying and I am not sure which to investigate more closely.
<BR>
Apparently when collector runs sometimes it seems to be unable to grab SNMP
<BR>
data from my Cisco router.  I don't know if this is caused because of:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. SNMP having a low priority on the Cisco and collector timing out too
<BR>
soon?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. My Cisco's CPU is too busy?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. A bug in the version of IOS I am running? (11.3.9T)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Something wrong with DNS resolution?
<BR>
<P>To see an example of what this is doing to the grtaphs take a look here:

<P>I am a bit confused about these error messages because some of the things it
<BR>
complains about don't make sense. For eaxmple in this email it mentions my
<BR>
portmaster stuff, but that script has been working fine.  It just seems like
<BR>
sometimes its unable to get an instance mapping from my Cisco?  Anyone got
<BR>
any ideas what I am dealing with here?  Thanks in advance!
