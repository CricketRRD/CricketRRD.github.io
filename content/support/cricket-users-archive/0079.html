From: Jeff Allen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jra@corp.webtv.net?Subject=Re:%20[cricket-announce]%20Cricket%200.64%20released!&In-Reply-To=&lt;199905182345.QAA22341@oops.artemis.com&gt;">jra@corp.webtv.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>After long hours of postponing the inevitable, I have released Cricket
<BR>
0.64. This is a big release -- more lines of code have changed than
<BR>
ever before.
<BR>
<P>There are some useful new features:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Cricket ignores comments in retrieved data
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You can defeat the cache during testing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You can monitor US Robotics modem chassis and all types of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portmasters now.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You can grab snapshots of GIFs easily
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You can pass arguments thru to RRD Tool when graphing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* You can set mtargets-ops to &quot;sum()&quot; and The Right Thing will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Less Perl code needs to be parsed when displaying cached
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIFs, potentially making the grapher a bit snappier.
<BR>
<P>There was a MAJOR infrastructural change too, which resulted in
<BR>
Cricket relying on a compiled form of the config tree (which lives in
<BR>
a file managed by the DB_File module). The collector will
<BR>
automatically recompile it when necessary, and the grapher will try to
<BR>
alert you when it needs to be recompiled. Creating this compiled form
<BR>
was necessary since for future features I need to have more info from
<BR>
the config tree available, and it would have been too slow to load it
<BR>
all every time. I will not go so far to say that the compiled form
<BR>
makes anything faster now -- it's actually a bit more cumbersome, and
<BR>
the startup time is comparable. But it will make future things easier,
<BR>
and that's really important, since we have a lot of good ideas that
<BR>
need to get implemented soon.
<BR>
<P>I also renamed the confusingly named collect-subtree script. It is now
<BR>
named collect-subtrees, and it operates on a file named subtree-sets,
<BR>
which has subtle changes to it. Be certain to read the CHANGES file to
<BR>
see how to migrate to the new (correctly named) system. It does the
<BR>
exact same thing still, it's just got more appropriate names now.
<BR>
<P>In other news, I will soon be transferring to a slightly different job
<BR>
within WebTV. I will be taking Cricket with me, and this new job will
<BR>
leave me about the same amount of time I've had to work on Cricket --
<BR>
not a huge amount, but you can rest assured it won't get ignored
<BR>
either.
<BR>
<P>Finally, keep the kind words coming. I've always said that WebTV wrote
<BR>
Cricket first and foremost to solve real problems we were having. But
<BR>
it's really nice to hear from people who are happy with it too. If you
<BR>
have a story about how it helped you, please send it to me. I'll keep
<BR>
them in a folder here and read them for inspiration when I am in the
<BR>
middle of fighting a heinous bug. :)
