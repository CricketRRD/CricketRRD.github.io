<BR>
<P>I've got a problem here and would like to know whether anyone has
<BR>
experienced it before and/or has come up with a solution.
<BR>
<P>The thing is: my collector gathers up the data from the routers and
<BR>
everything looks ok in the data files (*.rrd) as far as I can tell by using
<BR>
rrdtool dump.
<BR>
<P>But sometimes, some of the graphs will only show zeroes (a flat horizontal
<BR>
line covering the x axis). For instance, the hourly and weekly are zeroed
<BR>
out and the daily and monthly are ok. Sometime later (after another sample
<BR>
has been taken from the routers), everything is fine. Or even worse, some
<BR>
of the graphs that were ok come up zeroed out and some come up fine. I see
<BR>
no pattern as to which graphs will come up ok and which won't. And the
<BR>
error isn't even consistent among all interfaces of a single router: at the
<BR>
same moment when some interfaces have all graphs ok, some some others have
<BR>
zeroed graphs.
<BR>
<P>What thrills me is that, even though it's intermitent, it's not a cacheing
<BR>
problem. I've even tried deleting all of the /tmp/cricket-cache/* and all
<BR>
of my browser's cache, and there's no proxy between me and the server machine.
<BR>
<P>My setup:
<BR>
- Solaris 2.6 on a Sun Ultra 2,
<BR>
- Perl 5.0 patchlevel 4 subversion 4,
<BR>
- cricket-0.63,
<BR>
- rrdtool-0.99.22,
<BR>
- Digest-MD5-2.06,
<BR>
- SNMP_Session-0.70,
<BR>
- libwww-perl-5.42,
<BR>
- Time-HiRes-01.20,
<BR>
- HTML-Parser-2.22,
<BR>
- URI-1.02,
<BR>
- MIME-Base64-2.11,
<BR>
- libnet-1.0606.
<BR>
<P>Do I miss something? I'm aware of rrdtool-0.99.25, but it's the above setup
<BR>
that's giving me the problem. Since I don't see anything that could have
<BR>
been the cause of my problem in the CHANGES file that comes whith 0.99.25,
<BR>
I thought it was worth asking you before installing the new version.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
