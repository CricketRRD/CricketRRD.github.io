<BR>
<P>I've just been informed that we require some of our old MRTG
<BR>
data, such as the usage:
<BR>
<P>Max In:
<BR>
174.4 kB/s (90.3%) 
<BR>
Average In:
<BR>
10.2 kB/s (5.3%) 
<BR>
Current In:
<BR>
3420.0 B/s (1.8%) 
<BR>
<P>Max Out:
<BR>
20.0 kB/s (10.4%) 
<BR>
Average Out:
<BR>
6182.0 B/s (3.2%) 
<BR>
Current Out:
<BR>
4491.0 B/s (2.3%) 
<BR>
<P>MRTG 2.5.4 is giving this data, and it doesn't seem hard at all to hack
<BR>
into Cricket, but I thought I'd request here before duplicating work.
<BR>
This would be really great guys, and its all that prevents me from rm -rf'ing
<BR>
MRTG competely.  Well, almost....
<BR>
<P>When cricket generates the graphs, I have 4 perl processes taking loads of
<BR>
CPU time, and it takes a few seconds to load each graph, sometimes up to
<BR>
10 seconds.   The server is a P166MMX, slow, but not that slow.  MRTG, because
<BR>
the gifs aren't generated on the fly, is instant.  Would switching the
<BR>
server over to FastCGI and mod_perl from CGI help increase the speed?  Is
<BR>
there ANYTHING I can do?  This is the major #2 issues, especially when you
<BR>
are navigating the switch-ports pages, with 24 or 48 ports on each switch,
<BR>
the 2-3 second delays accessing the pages over a 100mbps on the local lan
<BR>
aren't acceptable to my boss.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for any help.
