From: &quot;Campbell Simpson&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Campbell.Simpson@telecom.co.nz?Subject=Re:%20[cricket-users]%20grapher.cgi%20problems&In-Reply-To=&lt;s767a4ab.014@groupwise.telecom.co.nz&gt;">Campbell.Simpson@telecom.co.nz</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>I was wondering if anyone could help me with getting the web based graphing CGI to work.
<BR>
<P>Everything is installed and &quot;collector&quot; works fine collecting the data. I have created the web directory &quot;public_html&quot; and grapher.cgi is installed under public_html/cricket/grapher.cgi. When I try to execute the CGI from a web browser I get the following error message in the web servers logs:
<BR>
<P>[16/Jun/1999:13:02:17] failure: for host 146.171.74.161 trying to GET /~grapher/cricket/grapher.cgi, cgi-parse-output reports: the CGI program /export/home/grapher/public_html/cricket/grapher.cgi did not produce a valid header (name without value: got line &quot;use of uninitialized value at /export/home/grapher/public_html/cricket/grapher.cgi line 624.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>I must have missed something when I was setting things up, but I can't seem to see what I've done.
<BR>
<P>Please help!
