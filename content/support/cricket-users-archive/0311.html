<P>Hi 
<BR>
<P>I was wondering if anyone had come across this problem. I'm am using cricket 0.65 and upgraded to 0.68 a day ago. No problems with the install but something funny happens with the web based cgi script. Under 0.65 when I went to &quot;router-interfaces&quot; and tried to click on one of the interfaces I am returned an error by the web server complaining about 
<BR>
<P>name without value: got line &quot;bareword &quot;interface&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use at (eval 4) line 1.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The rest of the targets are fine. When I upgrade to 0.68 the problem with router-interfaces goes away, but two different targets have the same sort of problem. 
<BR>
<P>use of uninitialized value at /export/home/cricket/public_html/cricket/./lib/configtree/cache.pm line 222.&quot;
<BR>
<P>There is also a strange link under switch-ports generated called &quot;Directories you can jump to&quot; which appears under 0.68. I can't work out where this is coming from since the Defaults file and interface file are in exactly the same format as the sample. 
<BR>
<P>I am using the &quot;Defaults&quot; files that came with 0.68 for the root and for the router-interface directory and have followed the examples in the sample-config. I'm running Netscape Enterprise Server on a Solaris 2.6 machine.
<BR>
<P>Any help you could give me would be much appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.
