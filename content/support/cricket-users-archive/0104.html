Hello,
<BR>
<P>Sorry if it's a dumb question but I am running cricket 0.63 and even
<BR>
though I looked for a way to add the max 2hours and days in a graph, I
<BR>
didn't find how I could do it (basically, I want to have a similar graph
<BR>
as the one I have with mrtg). 
<BR>
I see the rra info in the top Default file, so I suspect they are in
<BR>
the rrd files, but no other mention of it, so
<BR>
I supposed that it was linked with the ranges in the grapher, but didn't
<BR>
find anything. So for example with input/output, how can I get 2
<BR>
additional lines displaying the maximum values for a time period?
<BR>
I understand you can only have one AREA, but I guess there must be a way
<BR>
to get the max data. 
<BR>
<P>Also, if I want to poll high speed interfaces every minute for example,
<BR>
even if I put different rra info for the subtree, will collector get
<BR>
everything, and rrd simply ignoring the data, or will it not poll the
<BR>
data? So is it better to have a complete different cricket for different
<BR>
polling intervals?
<BR>
<P>thanks.
<BR>
<P>nicolas
