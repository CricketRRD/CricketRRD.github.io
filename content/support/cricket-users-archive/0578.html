<BR>
<P><P>Thanks to those who replied to my previous post.  (Like all good posts, I found the answer in the
<BR>
FAQ soon after the post :).
<BR>
<P>Comments on the below would be appreciated:
<BR>
<P>1. Against my better judgement I have installed Cricket in a path which is different to that
<BR>
recomended. (Please do not flame me, I do not have the option.)  As recommended in the FAQ's I have
<BR>
hardcoded the working directories where required. I also use the -base and the -cf options for
<BR>
compile and collect-sets respectively.
<BR>
<P>I have also had do some work on the code:
<BR>
<P>For the CGI perl code I have made a sub-routine (wrapper of sorts) to accomodate the lack of
<BR>
PATH_INFO in CGI::self_url.  This is a simple if $ENV{PATH_INFO} doesn't exist, make it equal to
<BR>
$ENV{SCRIPT_INFO};  Server is apache, with squid on accounting.
<BR>
<P>For the gif/png generation I have removed the option for -a, as rrd complained when used with this
<BR>
option (this surprised me, as no one else seems to have this problem).
<BR>
<P>I am interested  if any-one else has had to make any modifications such as above.
<BR>
<P>2. Also we have cisco 7200's.  I have set these to be 7500's but when running collect-sets, the max
<BR>
values are not displayed.  All other values are collected for these devices. Have you found the two
<BR>
to be equivalent oid-wise?
<BR>
<P>3. What means have people used to speed up the code.  (I haven't the option of using mod-perl :(
<BR>
<P>Thanks again
<BR>
