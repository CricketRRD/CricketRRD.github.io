Hi George,
<BR>
<P>I just went through this here at my company. The solution I came up with is as follows:
<BR>
<P>Use the &quot;generate-static = true&quot; in the Defaults files where you want to display to customers
<BR>
and setup the cron job to run the generate-statics program (I run it every hour).
<BR>
<P>I then setup a separate link in apache (<A HREF="http://www.yourserver.com/customer/">http://www.yourserver.com/customer/</A>) that points to the
<BR>
point in the config tree you want them to have access to
<BR>
(/home/cricket/public_html/static/router-interfaces/customer/) and put in a .htaccess file in
<BR>
this directory that has the customers (and admins) username/password. This got me to the point
<BR>
where I could see raw directories and individual gifs.
<BR>
<P>Final set was to whip up some quick perl that generated index.html's in each directory that
<BR>
have the same &quot;look and feel&quot; as my normal cricket pages and have links appropriate to the
<BR>
content of that directory :-) ie if the top dir has 3 sub dir's it has links to the
<BR>
index.html's in those subdir's auto-named according the sub-dir name. The final step was to
<BR>
generate an index at the target level with links to all the appropriate targets in the final
<BR>
directory and individual html files for each target. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;pauses to catch breath&gt;
<BR>
<P>If you or anyone else on the list is interested the quick and dirty perl scripts I used to do
<BR>
this, lemme know and I'll put them up on my FTP server :-)
<BR>
<P>The documentation for generating statics says &quot;Making HTML pages that incorporate the generated
<BR>
image files is left as an exercise to the reader.&quot; heh heh heh, so if you want to save some
<BR>
time I have done this exercise and can share :-)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;

<EM>&gt; Hi there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I tried to search the archives to find the answer, but the search engine on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onelist is to difficult to use. So it's asked before, I apologize here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Is there a way that I can limit my customers to only see the router-interfaces 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are using? In MRTG, it's simple because it's static page. Is there anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can do it with the graph.cgi in cricket? Or there are other ways to set it up?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Thanks.
