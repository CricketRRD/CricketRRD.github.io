From: Rob Windsor &lt;<A HREF="mailto:windsor@adc.com?Subject=Re:%20[cricket-users]%20rough%20day%20trying%20to%20set%20up%20rrdtool/cricket&In-Reply-To=&lt;199907211631.LAA14062@bbg.adc.com&gt;">windsor@adc.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>[I apologize for hitting both lists, but I'm not exactly sure which tool does 
<BR>
the snmp chatter.  -- Rob ]
<BR>
<P>Heyyo,
<BR>
<P>After fighting perl modules, BerkeleyDB, and the lack of caffeine all day 
<BR>
yesterday, I still haven't gotten rrdtool/cricket to behave.
<BR>
<P>Configuration info:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solaris 2.6/sparc
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perl 5.004001 (upgrading to 5.004_004 would take some effort since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perl is deeply rooted in our environment)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latest required perl modules as of yesterday
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was following the steps in cricket's doc/beginner.txt...
<BR>
<P>First up, I have to put the FQDN in the config file.  This is more annoying 
<BR>
than 'broken', but I'd rather not have to do that.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, where can I hardcode the 'home directory' for cricket so that I 
<BR>
don't have to create a new user?  I'm currently running mrtg as myself and I 
<BR>
really don't want to create *yet* *another* application-specific account on 
<BR>
our systems.  (My temporary fix is by doing &quot;HOME=/foo ../compile&quot;)  This is 
<BR>
probably a simple thing to chase down, but I haven't had a chance to do it yet 
<BR>
and figured that I would ask while I'm here.
<BR>
<P>Thirdly (and most importantly), I get the following, regardless of whether I 
<BR>
point it at a solaris box (yeah, I know Solaris 2.6 smpdx is less than 
<BR>
optimum) or either of our two NetApps:
<BR>
<P>[20-Jul-1999 17:55:18*] Received SNMP response with error code noSuchName
<BR>
[20-Jul-1999 17:55:18 ] Got: 
<BR>
[20-Jul-1999 17:55:18 ] Retrieved data for na1.bbg.adc.com (): U,U,U,U
<BR>
<P>Thanks in advance.
<BR>
<P>obtw, 'hi' to fellow former-Synopsys-ites.
<BR>
<P>-- Rob
