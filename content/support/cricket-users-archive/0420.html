<P>
It appears that Cricket is set up by default (i.e. in the sample-config)
<BR>
to collect maximal values during data reduction for 50-day and 600-day
<BR>
graphs (i.e. &quot;monthly&quot; and &quot;yearly&quot;), because I see them in the root
<BR>
level Defaults file:  (they're the ones that say &quot;MAX&quot; instead of
<BR>
&quot;AVERAGE&quot;)
<BR>
<P># one point per 5 minutes, spanning 50 hours
<BR>
rra             5minAve         AVERAGE:0.5:1:600
<BR>
# one point per 30 minutes, spanning 12 days
<BR>
rra             30minAve        AVERAGE:0.5:6:600
<BR>
# one point every 2 hours, spanning 50 days
<BR>
rra             2hrAve          AVERAGE:0.5:24:600
<BR>
rra             2hrMax          MAX:0.5:24:600
<BR>
# one point every day, spanning 600 days
<BR>
rra             1dayAve         AVERAGE:0.5:288:600
<BR>
rra             1dayMax         MAX:0.5:288:600
<BR>
<P>But what I don't follow is how can I get cricket to put this data on a
<BR>
graph?  I don't understand how graphing is tied back to RRAs that have
<BR>
been stored for the item being graphed.  Graphs for router-interfaces
<BR>
(for example, since that's what's most like MRTG) are defined like:
<BR>
<P>graph   ifInUcastPackets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color       =   dark-green
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw-as     =   AREA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y-axis      =   &quot;packets per second&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units       =   &quot;pkt/sec&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legend      =   &quot;Average num Packets In&quot;
<BR>
<P>But I don't see how this correlates back to the RRAs like 5minAve,
<BR>
30minAve, 2hrAve, 1dayAve (which is what Cricket is plotting now).  In
<BR>
fact, I can't see how those 'rra' lines in the root Defaults file are
<BR>
used anywhere at all.  It seems to me that if I can figure this part
<BR>
out, I should be able to make a graph that plots data from the 2hrMax
<BR>
RRA instead of (or in addition to) the 2hrAve RRA and I'd be able to get
<BR>
the same functionality that I had in MRTG.
<BR>
<P>Am I missing something obvious?  Every indication I've seen is that
<BR>
Cricket is supposed to do this (why put the MAX data into those RRAs
<BR>
otherwise?) but the few times I've seen this question come up on the
<BR>
mailing list archives, it's never been answered as far as I could tell.
<BR>
I'd rather not have to manually invoke rrdtool to make those graphs if I
<BR>
don't have to, but if that really is the only way to do it...  (FYI, I'm
<BR>
running Cricket 0.67 and rrdtool 0.99.49.)
